# Explainable AI - Model agnostic methods

## What is this?

In this repository, you will find our answers to the questions arising from the Bike Rental dataset and House Pricing dataset using model-agnostic methods. We developed the code using the RStudio environment.
## Model agnostic
Separating the explanations from the machine learning model gives flexibility. 
• If you compare the models in terms of interpretability, it is easier to do with model-agnostic explanations, because the same method can be used for any type of model.
• Desirable aspects of a model-agnostic explanation system:
• Model flexibility: Not being tied to an underlying particular machine learning model.
• Explanation flexibility: Not being tied to a certain form of explanation.
• Representation flexibility: The explanation system should not have to use the same feature representation as the model that is being explained.
